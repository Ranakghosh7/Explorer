Movie Explorer Backend

A lightweight, TypeScript-based backend service built with Express for fetching and serving movie data. This backend is designed to be the API layer for a Movie Explorer application, acting as a gateway between the frontend UI and external movie APIs (such as TMDB or others you may integrate).
